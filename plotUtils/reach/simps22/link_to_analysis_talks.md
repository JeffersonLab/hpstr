There are two talks that explain how this reach estimate was performed.
Both talks are linked here: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=349284806

'Combined SIMP Reach Estimate details for 2016 (GBL), 2019 (KF), and 2021 (KF)' shows the detailed reach estimate for each HPS run, however the 2016 results in this talk used GBL tracking and is deprecated. 

'2016 Reach Estimate using KF Tracking (and 2016+2019+2021 combined results and <pending> official plots)' updates the 2016 reach estimate using KF.
